//CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS AND THE NEW OPERATOR
//We can use constructor function to build an object using a function. A constructor function is a completely normal function. The only diff btw a constructor function and a regular function is that we call the constructor function with the new operator. We should constructor functions with capital letters. We can use the function expression and function statement for constructor functions. But the arrow function wont work because it does not have its own this keyword and we need that.

// const Person = function (fullName, birthYear) {
//     //filling the empty object;
//     //value name must be the exact same as the param passed. Tho, prop names can be diff..we could use any name as the prop name
//     //instance properties
//     this.fullName = fullName;
//     this.birthYear = birthYear;

//     //never create a method inside of a constructor function
//     //adding methods
//     // this.calcAge = function () {
//     //     console.log(2024 - this.birthYear);
//     // }
// }

// const jonas = new Person('Jonas', 1991);
// console.log(jonas);

// //what happens when we call a regular function with the new operator?
// // BTS these happen 4 steps;
// //1. A new empty obj {} is created
// //2. The function is called and the this keyword would be set to the newly created obj. The this keyword would point too the obj that ws created in step 1
// //3. Newly created obj{} is linked to a prototype
// //4. The obj{} created at the beginning is then automatically returned from the constructor function. The function automatically returns that empty object from the beginning.at this point the obj does not have to be empty

// //We can use this constructor function to create as many diff objs as we want
// const matilda = new Person('Matilda', 2017);
// const jaccques = new Person('Jaccques', 1954);
// console.log(matilda, jaccques);

// //we can now say jonas, matilda and jaccques are instances of Person

// //To test if the objs are instances of  the Person constructor function

// console.log(jonas instanceof Person);// this will return true or false
// const jay = 'Jay';
// console.log(jay instanceof Person);

// //constructor function are not a feature of the js language but  a pattern developed by other developers

// //PROTOTYPES
// console.log(Person.prototype);

// Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
//     console.log(2024 - this.birthYear);

// }

// jonas.calcAge();
// matilda.calcAge();

// console.log(jonas.__proto__);
// console.log(jonas.__proto__ === Person.prototype);

// //Person.prototype is the prototype of jonas and matilda
// console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas));
// console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(matilda));
// console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Person));

// //Person.prototype IS NOT the Person prototype. its the prototype of the linked objs

// //setting props on prototypes
// Person.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens'
// console.log(jonas, matilda, jaccques);1
// //this newly declared prop 'species' is not a property of the objs linked to it but of the prototype itself. those objs only have access to it,

// console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty('fullName'));
// console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty('species'));

// // Prototypal Inheritance and the Prototype Chain
// // jonas.age = 55;
// // console.log(jonas); //adding more props to jonas obj directly
// console.log(jonas.__proto__); //points to Person
// console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__);// Person to obj
// console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); //]obj points to null..object has no prototype of its own
// //object.Prototype = top of prototype chain

// //PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE ON BUILT-IN OBJECTS
// //to get function itself
// console.log(Person.prototype.constructor);
// //to inspect function
// console.dir(Person.prototype.constructor);

// //any function is also an obj so of course it has its prototype
// const arr = [3, 6, 4, 5, 6, 9, 6, 9, 3];  //new Array === []
// console.log(arr.__proto__); //prototype of this is Array and the prototype of Array is  object

// //All the arrays get access to all of this methods. Each of the arrays don't contain all of the methods but they'd inherit it from their prototype
// console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype);
// console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__);

// //the prototype prop of the constructor 'Array.prototype' is going to be the prototype of all the objects created by that constructor

// // const a = new Array (28999, 66777, 'hhc');
// // console.log(a);
// // console.log(arr);

// //adding new method to the prototype prop of the array constructor, therefore arrays called with the unique() will inherit the method
// Array.prototype.unique = function () {
//    return [...new Set(this)]
// };

// console.log(arr.unique());

// //We just extended. Extending the prototype of an array is generally not a good idea. If you're working on a small project of your own , y0u can use it

// const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');

// console.dir(x => x + 1);

This is necessary because the Car class has its own constructor that needs to be called to initialize the fullName and birthYear properties inherited by EV.

//Encapsulation: Protected Props and Methods
//encapsulation basically means to keep some props and methods private inside the class, so that they are not accessible from outside of the class, then the rest of the methods are basically exposed as a public interface, which we can also call API.
//2 big reasons for data encapsulation;
//1. To prevent code from outside of the class to accidentally manipulate our code from outside of the class
//2. When we expose only a small interface, then we can change  all the other internal methods with more confidence, because we can be sure that external codes does not rely on this private methods. Therefore our code wil not break when we do internal changes.
//JS classes do no yet support real data privacy and encapsulation

//Encapsulation: Private Class Fields and Methods
//Private Class Fields nd Methods are part of a bigger proposal for improving and changing javascript classes which is simply called Class Fields. This Class Fields is currently at stage 3 and not yet part of the JS language. However being at stage 3, its very likely that at some point it will move forward to stage 4 and it would become a part of JS language. In the proposal, there are 8 diff kinds of fields and methods...but we'd  focus on 4;
//1) Public fields
//2) Private fields
//3) Public methods
//4) Private methods
//Besides all these methods, we also have the static version all these 4

//1) PUBLIC FIELDS
//We can think of a public field as a prop that would be on all instances, thats  why we can also call public fields a 'public instance fields'. Public fields will be present on all instances that we are creating thru the class..but they are not on the prototype. Public fields are also referenceable  by the this keyword

//2) PRIVATE FIELDS
//With private fields, we can now make it so that props are really truly not accessible from the outside. # symbol is the syntax that makes a field private in this new class proposal. We'd get a syntax error when we try to read the #movements outside the class. Private fields must be declared in enclosing class. Remember that private fields are to be outside the constructor function. Again private fields are present on all instances and not the prototype.

//3) PUBLIC METHODS
//All the methods we've been using inside the class are public

//4)PRIVATE METHODS
//Are very useful to hide the implementation details from the outside


class Account {
    //PUBLIC FIELDS(instances)
    locale = navigator.language;

    //PRIVATE FIELDS
    #movements = [];
    //we did this because the pin property is set to a constructor function pram value. We basically just declare it without setting any thing to it.
    #pin;

    this.owner = owner;

  }

  requestLoan(vall) {
    if (this.#approveLoan(vall)) {
      this.deposit(vall);

    }

  //static method--only available on class and not on instances. We can only call this method with the class name e.g Account.helper();
  static helper(){

  // Private methods
